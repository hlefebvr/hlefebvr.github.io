<p>Hey there, my name is Henri, I’m French. I’m currently a Ph.D student at <a href="https://www.unibo.it/it">Alma mater studiorum - Università di Bologna</a>. My thesis subject can be summarized as <em>Decomposition methods for mixed-integer convex nonlinear optimization</em> and is part of the <a href="https://minoa-itn.fau.de/">MINOA</a> project. My main interests are in exact methods for optimization under uncertainty (stochastic and robust).</p>

<p>I graduated from the <a href="https://utc.fr/en.html">University of Technology of Compiègne</a> (France) in both their ingineering diploma in <a href="https://www.utc.fr/en/courses-and-training/the-utc-engineering-diploma/computer-sciences-and-engineering-gi/specialty-aids-to-logistic-decisions-gi-adel.html">decision support applied to logistics</a> and their master degree in <a href="https://www.utc.fr/formations/diplome-de-master/mention-ingenierie-des-systemes-complexes-isc/parcours-apprentissage-et-optimisation-des-systemes-complexes-aos.html">Learning and complex system optimization</a>. I also graduated from the <a href="https://unige.it/">Università degli studi di Genova</a> (Italy) with a master specialized in <a href="http://emecis.eu">Production systems and logistics</a>. In 2016, I went to the <a href="http://www.apply.shu.edu.cn/web/index.aspx">Shanghai University</a> (China), in the faculty of <a href="http://utseus.com/en/">UTSeuS</a>, for a study semester oriented in project management.</p>

<p>For my master thesis, I worked at the <a href="https://www.inria.fr/centre/bordeaux">Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest research laboratory</a> (France) on two-stage robust problems with mixed recourse decisions and objective uncertainty for a scheduling application.</p>
