I"û<p>This tutorial explains how to use the L-Solver library in order to model an optimization problem and to solve it via an external solver. The modeling framework in L-Solver is actually rather similar to some comercial solvers. The two most important classes to grasp are the Environment class and the Model class. Basically, an Environment is an object responsible for the life and death of its components. An environmentâ€™s components are (core) variables, (core) constraints and (core) objectives.</p>
