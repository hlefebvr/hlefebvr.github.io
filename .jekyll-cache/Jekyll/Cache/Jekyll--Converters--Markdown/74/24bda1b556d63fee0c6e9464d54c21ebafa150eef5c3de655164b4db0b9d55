I"Ì<p>Here are the <a href="https://github.com/hlefebvr/unige-production-system/raw/master/main.pdf">lecture notes</a> I took while I was a student at the Universit√† Degli Studi Di Genova. The course was taught by Prof. Michele Aicardi, in 2018. It explores production systems in various aspects, namely :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inventory management
    <ul>
      <li>Continuous review (both deterministic and stochastic model)</li>
      <li>Periodic review (Wagner-Miller theorem, Silver-Mill heuristic)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bill of materials
    <ul>
      <li>Batch sizing</li>
      <li>Scheduling</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
