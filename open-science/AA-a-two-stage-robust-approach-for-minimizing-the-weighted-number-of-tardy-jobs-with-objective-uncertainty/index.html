title: A two-stage robust approach for the weighted number of tardy jobs with objective uncertainty
layout: open_science

code: AA

open_methodology: >
    You can find our R reports <a href="methodology.rendered.html"
    class="attachment attachment-link">here</a>.

open_source: >
    Unfortunately, we are not able to provide an open source implementation of
    our appoach. However, it can be implemented using the now open-source
    library <a href="https://bapcod.math.u-bordeaux.fr/"
    target="_blank">BaPCod</a> or use the
    <a href="/idol" target="_blank">idol C++ framework</a>. At the time we published the
    paper, BaPCode was not open source and we were not allowed to share it.

open_data: >
    We have public instances (<code>instances.zip</code>) and open raw experimental results (<code>results.csv</code>). <br />
    The columns in <code>results.csv</code> are explained in the public rmarkdown (see open methodology) while the instances are given in the following format:
    <ul>
        <li>One line with the number of jobs: \( |\mathcal J| \) ;</li>
        <li>One line per job \(j\in\mathcal J\), with: \(w_j, r_j, d_j, p_j, \tau_j, \delta_j, f_j\).</li>
    </ul>
    The input data is separated by tabs or space.
