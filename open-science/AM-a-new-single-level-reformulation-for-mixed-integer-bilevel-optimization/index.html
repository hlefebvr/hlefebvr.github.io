title: "A New Single-Level Reformulation for Mixed-Integer Bilevel Optimization: Exact and Heuristic Approaches"
layout: open_science

code: AM

open_data: >
    All the instances which were used can be found on the <a href="https://bobilib.org/" target="_blank">BOBILib website</a>.
    As described in the paper, we considered all instances from the collection (visited on the 05/06/2025) which have binary leader decisions
    and bounded high-point relaxation.

open_source: >
    An implementation of the PADM is available in the open-source C++ library <a href="/idol" target="_blank">idol</a>.

open_education: >
    A poster which were presented at the <a href="https://www.mixedinteger.org/EUROMIP/2025/">MIP Europ Workshop</a> is available <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.
