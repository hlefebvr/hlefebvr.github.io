layout: open_science

code: AM

open_data: >
    All the instances which were used can be found on the <a href="https://bobilib.org/" target="_blank">BOBILib website</a>.
    As described in the paper, we considered all instances from the collection (visited on the 05/06/2025) which have binary leader decisions
    and bounded high-point relaxation.

open_methodology: > 
    Our data transformations can be found <a href="methodology.rendered.html">here</a>.

open_source: >
    An implementation of the PADM is available in the open-source C++ library <a href="/idol" target="_blank">idol</a>.

open_education: >
    A poster which were presented at the <a href="https://www.mixedinteger.org/EUROMIP/2025/">MIP Europ Workshop</a> is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlefebvr/hlefebvr.github.io/refs/heads/master/open-science/AM-a-new-single-level-reformulation-for-mixed-integer-bilevel-optimization/a-new-single-level-reformulation-for-mixed-integer-bilevel-optimization-poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
