Here are the [lecture notes](https://github.com/hlefebvr/unige-production-system/raw/master/main.pdf) I took while I was a student at the Università Degli Studi Di Genova. The course was taught by Prof. Michele Aicardi, in 2018. It explores production systems in various aspects, namely :
- Inventory management
    - Continuous review (both deterministic and stochastic model)
    - Periodic review (Wagner-Miller theorem, Silver-Mill heuristic)
- Bill of materials
    - Batch sizing
    - Scheduling

Source code can be found on my Github: hlefebvr.
