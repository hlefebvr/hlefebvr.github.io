title: Gödel's incompleteness theorem - idea of proof (French)
short: Written for a course at the UTC

---

Small docuement I wrote for a course on "Logic : History and formalism" (HE03 : Histoire et formalisme) taught by Dominique Fontaine at the University of Technology of Compiègne in which the idea behind the proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorem is given. 

Greatly inspired by [this awesome book](https://www.amazon.fr/Th%C3%A9or%C3%A8me-G%C3%B6del-Ernest-Nagel/dp/2020327783).
