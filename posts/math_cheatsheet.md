Here is a set of summaries of math courses I took during my studies at the University of Technology of Compi√®gne. It regroups the following :
- MT90-MT91/MT21 : Real functions (Taylor, derivatives, integrals, complex numbers, logic...)
- MT22 : Multivariate functions (integrals, geometry, ...)
- MT23 : Linear algebra (vectorial spaces, matrices, ...)
- MT09 : Numerical analysis (numerical schemes, integration, matrices, differential equations, ...)
- MT12 : Mathematical tools for Engineers (Fourrier transform, Laplace transform, distribution theory, Lesbegues, ...)

The source tex files are available on my github (hlefebvr). Contribution is very welcomed, especially for missing courses (SY01, SY02, RO04, RO05, MT10).
