Here are the [lecture notes](https://github.com/hlefebvr/ps23-course/raw/master/main.pdf) I took while I was a student at the University of Technology of Compiègne (in second year). The course was taught by Patrick Lanceleur and Emmanuel Perrey-Debain, in 2015. 

The source tex files are available on my github (hlefebvr).
