<h2>The crime</h2>

<h2>Why this is wrong?</h2>

<b>Major comments</b>

<ul>
    <li>Question is not answered.</li>
    <li>Step 2 asks to identify violated GUB constraints. The fractional solution will off course satisfy these constraints since they are part of the relaxation. So we will never reach the point where "the GUB constraint is violated". </li>
    <li>A bit confused about MILP relaxation and MILP formulation...</li>
</ul>

<b>Minor comments</b>

<ul>
    <li>Using "appropriate" is not appropriate.</li>
</ul>
