<h2>The crime</h2>

<h2>Why this is wrong?</h2>

<b>Major comments</b>

<ul>
    <li>I had to ask for a `FindGurobi.cmake` which really is what I was asking for.</li>
    <li>The provided `FindGurobi.cmake` does not look for the gurobi c++ library... Only for the C interface. This results in `undefined references` at linkage time.</li>
    <li>Does not handle the `REQUIRED` CMake keyword and ignores it when Gurobi is not found.</li>
</ul>

<b>Minor comments</b>

<ul>
    <li>Does not reference the official `FindGurobi.cmake`.</li>
    <li>Exports cache variables which is bad practice.</li>
</ul>
