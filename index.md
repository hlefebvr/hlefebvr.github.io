## Bio

Henri Lefebvre is a Ph.D student in Optimization and Operations Research at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). He earned a Master Degree in “Machine learning and optimization of complex systems” from the [University of Technology at Compiègne](https://utc.fr/en.html) (France) in 2019, after graduating the same year from the [University of Genova](https://unige.it/) (Italy) with an MSc in “Computer Systems Engineering” focusing on production systems and logistics.

He conducted his master thesis at the [INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest research laboratory](https://www.inria.fr/centre/bordeaux) (Bordeaux, France) on two-stage robust optimization problems with specific applications in scheduling. This work was awarded the prize for best master thesis in 2020 by the French Operations Research Society (ROADEF).

Since graduating, his main research interests have been in optimization under uncertainty and exact decomposition methods for large-scale problems. In particular, his work focuses on exact methods for adaptive optimization problems with mixed-integer wait-and-see feasible space by exploiting polyhedral analysis results and decomposition approaches.

Henri’s Ph.D thesis is funded by the European Union’s EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2022) under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Grant agreement number 764759 and is part of the [“Mixed Integer Nonlinear Optimization: Algorithms and Applications”](https://minoa-itn.fau.de/) (MINOA) project.
