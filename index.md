## Bio

Hey there, my name is Henri, I'm French. I'm currently a Ph.D student at [Alma mater studiorum - Università di Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). My thesis subject can be summarized as _Decomposition methods for adaptive robust optimization_ and is part of the [MINOA](https://minoa-itn.fau.de/) project. My main interests are in exact methods for optimization under uncertainty (stochastic and robust). 

I graduated from the [University of Technology of Compiègne](https://utc.fr/en.html) (France) in both their engineering diploma in [decision support applied to logistics](https://www.utc.fr/en/courses-and-training/the-utc-engineering-diploma/computer-sciences-and-engineering-gi/specialty-aids-to-logistic-decisions-gi-adel.html) and their master degree in [Learning and complex system optimization](https://www.utc.fr/formations/diplome-de-master/mention-ingenierie-des-systemes-complexes-isc/parcours-apprentissage-et-optimisation-des-systemes-complexes-aos.html). I also graduated from the [Università degli studi di Genova](https://unige.it/) (Italy) with a master specialized in [Production systems and logistics](http://emecis.eu). In 2016, I went to the [Shanghai University](http://www.apply.shu.edu.cn/web/index.aspx) (China), in the faculty of [UTSeuS](http://utseus.com/en/), for a study semester oriented in project management.

For my master thesis, I worked at the [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest research laboratory](https://www.inria.fr/centre/bordeaux) (France) on two-stage robust problems with mixed recourse decisions and objective uncertainty for a scheduling application.
