## Bio
Hey there, my name is Henri Lefebvre, I'm French. I studied at the [University of Technology of Compiègne](https://utc.fr/en.html) (France) for a master degree and an engineer degree in [Decision support applied to logistics](https://www.utc.fr/en/courses-and-training/the-utc-engineering-diploma/computer-sciences-and-engineering-gi/specialty-aids-to-logistic-decisions-gi-adel.html) where I discovered the exciting fields of Optimization and Operations Research. I also have a double diploma of master from the [Università degli studi di Genova](https://unige.it/) (Italy) specialized in [Production systems and logistics](http://emecis.eu). In 2016, I went to the [Shanghai University](http://www.apply.shu.edu.cn/web/index.aspx) (China), in the faculty of [UTSeuS](http://utseus.com/en/), for a study semester oriented in management. I am currently an intern at the [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest research laboratory](https://www.inria.fr/centre/bordeaux) (France) where I work on robust optimization applied to scheduling (in particular, minimizing the weighted number of tardy jobs under uncertainty with integer recourses). 

What to expect from this website ? Nothing, actually. This is just the place I use to post things I want to share with others. Be it science or philosophy, poetry or coding, meaningful or meaningless.
