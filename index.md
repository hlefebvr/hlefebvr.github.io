## Bio

I am a Ph.D student in Mathematical Optimization and Operations Research at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). My main research interests are in optimization under uncertainty and exact decomposition methods for large-scale problems. In particular, my work focuses on exact methods for adjustable robust problems with mixed-integer second-stage decisions by exploiting polyhedral analysis results and decomposition approaches.

I earned a Master Degree in “Machine learning and optimization of complex systems” from the [University of Technology of Compiègne](https://utc.fr/en.html) (France) in 2019 as well as an Engineer degree from the same school, after graduating the same year from the [University of Genova](https://unige.it/) (Italy) with an MSc in “Computer Systems Engineering” focusing on production systems and logistics.

I conducted my master thesis at the [INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest research laboratory](https://www.inria.fr/centre/bordeaux) (Bordeaux, France) on two-stage robust optimization problems with specific applications in scheduling with Boris Detienne and François Clautiaux. Our work was awarded the prize for best master thesis in 2020 by the French Operations Research Society (ROADEF).

My Ph.D thesis was (partially) funded by the European Union’s EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2022) under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Grant agreement number 764759 and was part of the [“Mixed Integer Nonlinear Optimization: Algorithms and Applications”](https://minoa-itn.fau.de/) (MINOA) project.
