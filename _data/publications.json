      "abstract": "The literature on pessimistic bilevel optimization with coupling constraints is rather scarce and it has been common sense that these problems are harder to tackle than pessimistic bilevel problems without coupling constraints. In this note, we show that this is not the case. To this end, given a pessimistic problem with coupling constraints, we derive a pessimistic problem without coupling constraints that has the same set of globally optimal solutions. Moreover, our results also show that one can equivalently replace a pessimistic problem with such constraints with an optimistic problem without coupling constraints. This paves the way of both transferring theory and solution techniques from any type of these problems to any other one.",

The idea is to explain the outcome of a model by presenting a certain change in the input of the model so that the outcome changes significantly. In this paper, we study this question for linear optimization problems as an automated decision-making tool. This leads to a new class of linear bilevel optimization problems that have more nonlinearities in their single-level reformulations compared to traditionally studied linear bilevel problems. For this class of problems, we present a tailored penalty alternating direction method and present its convergence theory that mainly ensures that we compute stationary points of the single-level reformulation. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of this method using the example of a real-world energy system model as well as by computing counterfactual explanations for a large set of linear optimization problems from the NETLIB as it has been proposed in the recent literature.",

      "abstract": "Adjustable robust optimization (ARO) is a powerful tool to model problems that have uncertain data and that feature a two-stage decision making process. Computationally, they are often addressed using the column-and-constraint generation (CCG) algorithm introduced by Zeng and Zhao (2013). While it was empirically shown that the algorithm scales well if all second-stage decisions are continuous, the presence of integer variables in the second stage rapidly leads to challenging large-scale mixed-integer problems within CCG. These problems can no longer be solved to global optimality within reasonable time limits in general. In this work, we explicitly focus on ARO problems with mixed-integer second-stage decisions and discuss the main difficulties of successfully applying CCG to this problem class. We then introduce, for a large set of problems with specific structural properties, a stronger formulation, which can be used in place of the master problem in the classic CCG algorithm. We show how this model can be effectively solved by column generation (CG). Additionally, we introduce a new CG-based heuristic that is able to generate new feasible points to speed up the overall method. We apply this nested scheme, combining CCG and CG, to two problems in logistics and scheduling. The numerical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the classic CCG.",

      "abstract": "Adjustable Robust Optimization (ARO) is a paradigm for facing uncertainty in a decision problem, in case some recourse actions are allowed after the actual value of all input parameters is revealed. While several approaches have been introduced for the linear case, little is known regarding exact methods for the convex case. In this work, we introduce a new general framework for attacking ARO problems involving convex functions in the recourse problem. We first recall a semi-infinite reformulation of the problem and, provided that one can solve a non-convex separation problem, show how to solve it either by a generalized Benders decomposition or by a column-and-constraint generation approach. For the relevant case in which the uncertainty set has an affine mapping to a 0-1 polytope, we show that the separation problem can be reformulated as a convex Mixed-Integer NonLinear Problem, thus allowing us to derive computationally sound exact methods. Finally, we apply the resulting algorithms to two different applications, namely a nonlinear facility location problem and a nonlinear resource allocation problem, to numerically assess their computational performance.",

However, there is no difference between linear bilevel problems with and without coupling constraints w.r.t. their complexity-theoretical hardness. In this note, we prove that, although there is a clear difference between these two classes of problems in terms of their feasible sets, the classes are equivalent on the level of optimal solutions.

Additionally, we extend an enumerative algorithm akin to a branch-and-cut scheme for which we study the asymptotic convergence.

In this paper, we develop a two-stage robust approach, where exact weights are known after accepting to perform the jobs, and before sequencing them on the machine. This assumption allows diverse recourse decisions to be taken in order to better adapt one's tactical plan. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, we introduce a new scheduling problem and model it as a min-max-min optimization problem with mixed-integer recourse by extending existing models proposed for the classical problem where all the costs are assumed to be known. Second, we take advantage of the special structure of the problem to propose two solution approaches based on results from the recent robust optimization literature, namely finite adaptability (Bertsimas and Caramanis, 2010) and a convexification-based approach (Arslan and Detienne, 2020). We also study the cost of finding anchored solutions, where the sequence of jobs has to be decided before the uncertainty is revealed. Computational experiments to analyze the effectiveness of our approaches are reported.",
